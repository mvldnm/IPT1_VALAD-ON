    <p>
      My name is Mico L. Valad-on, and I was born and raised in Malabon City. I am currently studying at the City of
      Malabon University as a 3rd-year college student, majoring in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Iâ€™ve
      always been passionate about technology, and I am particularly interested in learning more about it. Additionally,
      I am an outgoing person and can be loud when I feel comfortable around someone I vibe with.
